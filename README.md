====

fint (find interesting) ist a Python script to find certain files of interest during a forensic investigation. Interesting files can be files that have a certain MD5 fingerprint, a certain size, or in case of executable files a certain date they were compiled on. Especially, malicious software can be easily detected by its compile date, since it is usually rather recent.
